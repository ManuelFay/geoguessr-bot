# GeoGuessr ML Competition

## Introduction

Geoguessr is a game where you are dropped in a random location in the world and you have to guess where you are. You can move around and look for clues to help you guess. The closer you are to the actual location, the more points you get.

In this Kaggle challenge, we are given a training set of images along with their GPS location, 
and we have to predict the location of the test set images.
